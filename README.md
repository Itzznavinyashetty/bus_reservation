# bus_reservation
Bus Reservation System is based on the concept of reserving bus seats for the passengers. While booking tickets, the user has to enter bus number then the system displays total bus seat numbers with passengers name and the user has to enter the number of tickets, seat number, and name, age and phone number of the person.
